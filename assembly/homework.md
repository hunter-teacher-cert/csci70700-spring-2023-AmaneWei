Assembly Homework Assignment
Due:	Thursday 3/16

Task:	Write a program in Assembly to do ONE of the following:

Mild:		Print 2 lines of text. Choose your own fun and interesting message. 
		Example:	Hello, teachers!
				Let’s code in assembly!

Medium:	Add 3 numbers and print the sum. The 3 numbers can be hard coded 
(you don’t need to get user input). Be careful to make the sum a single digit (i.e. a number less than 10). Double digits make the code MUCH more complicated.

Spicy:		Take the user’s name as input and print “Hello, (name)” as output.


Use the online assembly compiler that was used in class for the code along to create and run your code. Note that this program does NOT save your work if you close the tab, so make sure to copy+paste into a text file on your computer.

Submit your code as a .txt file with the name assembly_hw.txt in the assembly folder in your class GitHub repo.

*The last 2 slides contain sample code for a program to ask the user for two numbers and then print the sum. This may be helpful for anyone working on the spicy challenge!
